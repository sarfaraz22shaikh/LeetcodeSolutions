LEETCODE 2914
You are given a 0-indexed binary string s having an even length.

A string is beautiful if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

Each substring has an even length.
Each substring contains only 1's or only 0's.
You can change any character in s to 0 or 1.

Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string s beautiful


<-----------APPROCH--------------------->
1) we absorbe that the nos partision we make dont change the answer 
so we tries to smallest partision of length 2
we run a for loop and just comapir the characters as u can se

<------------SOLUTION-------------------->
class Solution {
    public int minChanges(String str) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=1 ; i<str.length() ; i = i+2){
            if( str.charAt(i-1) != str.charAt(i)){
                count++;
            }
        }
   return count;
    }
}
