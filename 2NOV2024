2490. Circular Sentence

Easy

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is circular if:

The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.

Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.


<<--------------------------------APPROACH------------------------------->>
we make a string array to store differnt word of sentences 
each time the string at index i is compair with string of index (i + 1)%n i use this to make sure
when i points to last element of array then i+1 should  point to first element of array
if in any case this condition is unsatisfies i simply return false otherwise it will return
true after for loop end
<<--------------------------------JAVA CODE SUBMITTED------------------------------->>
// brute force;
class Solution {
    public boolean isCircularSentence(String str) {
      String arr[] = str.split(" ");
      int n = arr.length;
        for(int i=0 ; i < arr.length ; i++){
            if(arr[i].charAt( arr[i].length() - 1) != arr[ (i+1) % n].charAt(0) ){
             return false;
            }
        }
           return true;
    }
}
